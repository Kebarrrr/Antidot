# Welcome to Our Capstone Project!

Thank you for exploring our Capstone Project! This project is the culmination of extensive work, research, and development aimed at providing an intuitive and effective mobile solution. Here’s everything you need to know to get started!

## Features

- **AI/ML Integration:** We’ve integrated powerful AI/ML models using **Flask** to provide real-time predictions based on user inputs. Unlike the initial plan to use TFLite, we chose Flask for better flexibility and API integration.
  
- **Symptom Input:** To minimize input errors, we’ve added **autocomplete text** features that make it easy for users to select symptoms as they type. This ensures more accurate data input!

- **Antibiotic List Search:** Our **search bar** feature allows users to quickly find the antibiotic they are looking for from the list, enhancing the overall user experience and ease of use.

- **Customizable Design:** User experience was a priority, so we’ve implemented a smooth, intuitive UI/UX design to make navigation seamless.
